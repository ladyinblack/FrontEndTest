# FrontEndTest for Immedia - First Draft

Note: jQuery and Bootstrap libraries are required as I've used them locally, and not from CDN.

Start by opening index.html.  I've used Bootstrap as I like the way it gives my apps a good, neat and mobile look.  That does not mean I don't know much CSS, I didn't want to go too much over-styling for this simple app, as I do have a habit of doing that.

Tested, and works, on Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.  Seems to work faster on Chrome than on Firefox.

Note again: Uses my Foursquare client secret, which is fine as I can change/remove that when I need to create another app.
